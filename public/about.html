<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>
  Hi, I’m Rheyna—a silent strategist, a system sorceress, and a creator in constant evolution.
</p>

<p>
  By trade, I work in the world of Salesforce, automation, and digital systems, helping teams move smarter and smoother. But beyond the dashboards and flows, I’m an artist, a coder, and a seeker—building not just projects, but portals to deeper connection, creativity, and change.
</p>

<p>
  My world blends logic and mysticism, structure and soul. I believe in intentional disruption—creating instead of consuming, designing tools that serve people (not just profit), and weaving beauty into function.
</p>

<p>
  Whether I’m crafting a business process, painting by candlelight, or planning a creative space where others can thrive—I show up with precision, intuition, and a quiet kind of fire.

  This portfolio is a mirror of the paths I walk: analytical, spiritual, creative, and physical. Welcome to my world.
